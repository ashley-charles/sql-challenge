# sql-challenge

The `EmployeeSQL` folder contains a data folder with the CSV resources, and two SQL files `data engineering table schemata.sql`  and `employee queries.sql`:

  * The `data engineering table schemata.sql` file builds a database containing tables holding employee related data from the imported csv files. Relationships are defined between tables and columns using primary keys, composite keys and foreign keys.
  * The `employee queries.sql` file queries the requested employee information as outlined in the Module 9 instructions.

# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
  The `data modeling erd.png` visualizes the structure of the tables and relationships between the related tables of the database. (This ERD was sketched using QuickDBD)
